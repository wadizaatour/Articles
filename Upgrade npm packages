Updating local and global packages you downloaded from the registry helps keep your code and tools stable, usable, and secure.

Updating local packages

Navigate to the root directory of your project and ensure it contains a package.json file:

 
cd /path/to/project
In your project root directory, run the update command:

 
npm update
To test the update, run the outdated command. There should not be any output.

 
npm outdated


npm-check-updates
The tool we are going to use is called npm-check-updates. You can find a full list of commands and flags here, but the quick steps are listed below.

Install the tool npm install -g npm-check-updates
Verify that your package.json is checked in to version control (the next command will overwrite the package.json)
Validate the changes to your package.json
Install the new packages npm install
